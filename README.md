[HTML (HyperText Markup Language)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is the basic building blocks of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content along with other technologies used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation using CSS or functionality/behavior using JavaScript.

[Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS also describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
